      <h3 class="preface">Here is something I wrote while drinking:</h3>
				<p class="text">When I was a child – a stupid-secular-American child – I believed in Santa Claus.  When asked in kindergarten to count as high as I could, I was able to count 1-365 seamlessly, because I knew that that’s how many days it took to get from one Christmas to the next.  If you didn’t grasp that entirely, I, at the time a five-year-old, took the time out of my busy schedule to learn basic combinatorics, solely to know how many days were until the next Christmas.</p> 
        <p>It was my reason to live.</p>
        <p>I had my routine set for the entire month of December from ages eight to eleven (I will irrefutably deny that eleven is too old to believe in Santa, if there is any age to believe in Santa).  Every night the week before Christmas, at 8 o’clock, squeaky clean in fresh Christmas pajamas (adorned with the fat man himself), I would strut my way on into the living room with the respective halves of one Thomas plain bagel in each hand – Philadelphia whipped cream cheese riding shotgun.  And in that living room I would sit, seven nights a week, watching a different Christmas movie: How the Grinch Stole Christmas, a Christmas Story, The Polar Express, etc.  And after those movies, I could barely sleep I was so excited.</p>  
         <div class="pic">
           <img class="santapic" src="https://cdn.glitch.com/b3811412-f2a1-4d02-9f53-45538425a1a7%2Fsanta.jpg?1531414077905"/>
         </div>
       
      <p>This all came to a screeching halt, and ensuing eruption of tears, on the fateful evening of December 18th, 2004 – only 6 days before Santa was set to land on my roof and deliver this year’s consignment of transitory happiness.  The movie was The Santa Claus with Tim Allen.</p> 
        
      <p>Scott Calvin, played by Tim Allen, had just killed Santa Claus and now was on his way to deliver the rest of the world’s gifts (because that's how it works, apparently).  So, as Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, the rest of the reindeers – to clarify, also do not exist – brought Scott to the next house, something in the mood changed a little bit, and little me started to pick up on it.  There was no chimney on this particular roof, and no chimney means no fireplace – this poses a substantial problem for Santa Claus.  So, Scott (Santa) went back into the sleigh, picked up the red-velvet bag of lies, which hoisted him in air, over a steam vent, and down into a house where a fireplace miraculously appeared from the drywall. That was it, the exact moment that got me to stop believing in Santa Claus.</p> 
        
      <p>Forget how literally everything else had slipped through my net of logic.  I, aged 11, immediately summoned my mother and asked her, more so told her, that Santa Claus isn’t real?  In tears, she responded with – I will never forget this shit – “I cannot tell a lie.”</p> 
        
      <p>Poop do you mean you cannot tell a lie?  You, like every other parent, have been lying through your teeth for the majority of my childhood – arguably a very important time for character development.  And what’s even worse, is she didn’t act alone.  It’s not like I could scan a room with a pointed finger and say, “maybe I shouldn’t trust… her.” Nope.  Everyone was in on it; as if they had corroborated this lie before I was even conceived – my parents, your parents, their parents, toy stores, even the fucking national news: I remember watching a military radar on a national news channel track Santa’s sleigh across Russia, in “real time,” by finding a signal from Rudolph’s fucking nose.  Well played, America!</p> 
        
      <p>My eyes now open, I was immediately able to extrapolate that the tooth-fairy, and the Easter bunny also do not exist.  My world came crashing down, as did the bagels from my hands, no longer able to carry the aggregate weight of my tears, soggy bread, and the truth.</p> 
        
      <p>If you hit a child as it grows up, that child will grow up violent.  But if you build a kid’s life around a lie, you cannot blame them for never trusting anything again.</p>
